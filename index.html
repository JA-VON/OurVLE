<p>Thanks for using OurVLE for iOS. OurVLE runs on the open source Moodle software and this app was built using Moodle API and any functions made available by the guys at MITS who made OurVLE. </p>

<p>As you might have seen by now my name is Javon Davis(<a href="https://github.com/JA-VON" class="user-mention">@JA-VON</a>). I am/was a student at the University of the West Indies(Graduating October 2016) where I received my B.Sc in Computer Science and a minor in Math. I love making apps and while I was at UWI I worked on an OurVLE Android for MITS. I've also worked on sites like <a href="http://www.loopjamaica.com/">Loop</a> and the Jamaica Experiences <a href="http://www.jamaicaexperiences.com/">website</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/jm/app/jamaica-experiences/id1060263506?mt=8">iOS App</a> and I even made this little game called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chatois.app&amp;hl=en">Chatois</a> so check it out and feel free to let me know what you think. Anywho, thanks for reading and I hope the app was useful to you.</p>

<p>This app was built upon open source software and it's only fitting that it itself is open source. I will make a sincere effort to open issues for features and ensure to assign a person to a feature only when that person is actively working on it. Feel free open any issues or bugs found in the app yourself and I'm especially encouraging students at the University to contribute to its development to improve the user experiences for all students at our school. Comment on an issue you'd like to work on and I'll assign it to you and send in the pull request once you think it's ready and I'll check it out and get it published to the app store. I'll also make sure to update any fields in the repository and on the app store to credit any contributors for their contributions.  </p>

<p>Having trouble with OurVLE for iOS? Note this app is not affiliated with The University of the West Indies in any way and as such cannot be used to resolve any issues of not seeing a course you think you should be seeing. If for some reason you're not seeing a course in the app that you are seeing on the OurVLE website feel free to send me an email at <a href="mailto:javonldavis14@gmail.com">javonldavis14@gmail.com</a> and I'll try and get that resolved. </p>
